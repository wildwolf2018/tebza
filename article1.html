   			<div class="article-container">
   			<p>Ever since my junior primary school years I have always played video games. Whether at an arcade or at the local shop. Even when I was busy with my Computer Science degree I never lost interest in playing games.</p>
   			<p>After a brief detour into teaching I got the opportunity to intern at reputable gaming studio. It was tough learning experience about the gaming industry. That's when I first realised that there's more to gaming than just playing or coding them. It was what I  needed to see if my passion for video games was just childhood nostalgia Â or a lifelong love.</p>
   			<p>Fast forward to 2021. After months of being unemployed I decided to start a side hustle to make some extra cash on the side. The first thing that popped into my head was, why not make a simple game , have it published and see if it becomes a moderate success.</p>
   			<p>An article about how difficult it is to sell video games in Africa was discouraging. I dropped the games idea and tried other ventures. After a short while I dropped them too.</p>
   			<p>Three months ago after watching a marathon 10 hour YouTube video of Naughty Dog's Last of Us 2, I realized that my passion for video games was still burning as hot as it was when I was young.</p>
   			<p>I finally decided to combine it with my other love, Mathematics, to focus on game programming. You know what, 3 months later I can honestly say without regret that I'm happy with my decision.</p>
   			<p>The game that I have recently finished developing isn't really a new game. It's a remake of my 2016 Snakes and Ladders game made using HTML5 and Javascript. My goal is to publish a game that I had made and to see it being played on mobile and PC. And of course I wouldn't mind if it made some cash.</p>
   			<p>Whether the game is successful or not, I want to be able look at it with pride being displayed on a gaming store  and say, hey I made that. I hope this article will encourage anyone who wants to make games to never give up. Don't worry too much about what you don't have and focus more on what you do have. Use that to reach your goal.</p>
   			<p>In future I want to start writing about the Mathematics used in game development.  I want to give my take on 3D Maths. My blog is going to focus on the Mathematics and Physics used in game programming. And of course I will also write about any interesting topic concerning the game industry.</p>
   			<p>Thank you for reading  about my journey in video games. See you next time.</p></div>
